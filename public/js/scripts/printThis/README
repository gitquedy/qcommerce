printThis 1.5

Printing plug-in for jQuery

Please read:

I ask all users reporting bugs to:
    - create a jsfiddle (http://www.jsfiddle.net) or give an example url
    - set the option "debug: true" and inspect the iframe created by printThis and report on what is contained in the iframe

I am unable to debug with limited information and need each user to actively participate in the debugging process.


ToDo:
    - Look at more efficient form field value persist
    - Look at alternative to setTimeout ($.deferred?)
